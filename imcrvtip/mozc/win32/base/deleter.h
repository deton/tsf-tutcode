// This class implements the *deletion_range* mechanism of the Mozc protocol.
// When the client receives an output which contains *deletion_range*,
// a certain number of keydown/up pairs of VK_BACK will be sent to the
// application before the output is applied by the IME module, like MS-IME
// and ATOK do.
// Here is how this works.
//  1. IME DLL receives an output which contains *deletion_range*.
//  2. IME DLL enqueues the output so that it will be applied after the
//     application deletes the characters to be deleted.
//  3. IME DLL generates ([required deletion count] + 1) keydown/up pairs
//     of VK_BACK.
//  4. As for ([required deletion count]) keydown/up pairs of VK_BACK will be
//     handled by the application to delete [required deletion count] of
//     characters.
//  5. The last keydown/up pair of VK_BACK will be consumed by the IME module
//     and never be sent to the application.  With these key events, the IME
//     module can interrupt just after character delete events.
// - VK_BACK down  | Delivered to the application to delete a character.
// - VK_BACK up    | Delivered to the application to do nothing.
// - VK_BACK down  | Delivered to the application to delete a character.
// - VK_BACK up    | Delivered to the application to do nothing.
// - ...
// - VK_BACK down  | Consumed by the IME to start any pending action.
// - VK_BACK up    | Consumed by the IME to call EndDeletion.
